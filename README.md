This project implements a [GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) decoder
in the [Ć programming language](http://cito.sourceforge.net/).
Ć can be automatically translated to pure
C, Java, C#, JavaScript, ActionScript, Perl and [D](http://dlang.org/)
with no additional dependencies.

An HTML 5 example with decoding performed in JavaScript (translated from Ć)
is included.
